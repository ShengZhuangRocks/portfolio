A full stack React app, I build from scratch to manage job applications in the job searching process.

The main purpose is to manage job applications that applied from different sites, like: Indeed, Seek etc or other source all in one place.

The main functionalities include:

- import job advertisement information from url
- highlight key information
- toggle application status
- manage and keep track of events like phone calls and interviews
